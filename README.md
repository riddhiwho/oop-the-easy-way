# Oops!

Forget all the fancy jargon around OOP. Let's unravel the mystery around object-oriented paradigm, one concept at a time. Although, I would be programming in Python, the series is largely language-agnostic.

Goal:
- Understand the concepts around object-oriented programming from scratch with lots and lots of examples. 
- Be able to understand the huge codebases so you never get lost again.
- Design and build your own applications by following OO design paradigm.

ETA:
- 1 week, tops.
